🛡️ ResQnize — Smart Emergency Recognition & Instant Response System

ResQnize is an intelligent emergency recognition and response platform designed to detect critical situations such as falls, accidents, or abnormal health activity in real time and instantly alert trusted contacts with live location sharing.

The mission is simple:

Recognize emergencies early. Respond instantly. Save lives.

In moments where a person cannot call for help, ResQnize acts as a silent digital guardian — always monitoring, always ready.

🌍 Why ResQnize?

Emergencies don’t come with warnings.

Situations like:

sudden falls

road accidents

unconsciousness

panic attacks

abnormal heart rate patterns

often happen when someone is alone or unable to reach their phone.

Traditional safety systems fail because they depend on manual action.

ResQnize solves this gap through automated detection and instant emergency response workflows.

💡 What ResQnize Does

ResQnize combines wearable sensor monitoring with smartphone connectivity to provide a fast, reliable emergency support system.

The platform:

✅ continuously tracks motion and health signals
✅ recognizes abnormal or dangerous activity
✅ triggers instant alerts automatically
✅ shares real-time GPS location with emergency contacts
✅ reduces response time when seconds matter

⚙️ Core Features
🚨 Real-Time Emergency Detection

ResQnize uses wearable sensors to identify emergency-like events such as:

fall detection

abnormal inactivity

sudden impact patterns

health signal irregularities

📍 Instant Location Sharing

When an emergency is detected, the system sends the user’s live GPS location to trusted contacts for faster rescue.

📲 Smart Alert & Notification System

Once triggered, ResQnize automatically:

sends emergency notifications

activates response protocols

provides a short cancel window to avoid false alarms

🔗 Wearable + Mobile Integration (BLE)
